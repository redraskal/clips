Goals:

- Share video game clips with friends
- Organizing my clips

Later:

- Good search system
- Watch together session (queue up clips on website, fun reactions for each clip, maybe a score system, maybe by default it shows clips from today)

- Upload backend
- WebSocket & JSON API for upload progress
- Generating thumbnail
- Generate wave graph (show audio volume of clip)
- Upload frontend
